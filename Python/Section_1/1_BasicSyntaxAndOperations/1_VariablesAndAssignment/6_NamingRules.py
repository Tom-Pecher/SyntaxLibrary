## Python: 1.1.1.6 - Naming Rules


# Variable names must only contain letters, digits, and underscores:
snake_case = True
_variable123 = "okay"

# Variable names cannot start with a digit:
# 2fast = "no"

# Names are case sensitive, the following are different variables:
data = 42
Data = 17

# Reserved keywords cannot be used as variable names:
# True = 42
